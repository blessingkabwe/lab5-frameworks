## Features Implemented

### Bootstrap Demo
- Created a responsive navbar
- Implemented a two-column layout using Bootstrap's grid system
- Added styled button and alert components
- Used only Bootstrap classes (no custom CSS)

### Tailwind CSS Demo
- Built a responsive card layout with 3 cards
- Cards adjust from 1 to 3 columns based on screen size
- Each card contains an image, headline, description, and CTA button
- Used Tailwind utility classes for all styling

### React Demo
- Created a WelcomeMessage component that accepts a name prop
- Implemented state management with useState hook
- Added button to toggle between showing/hiding the welcome message
- Styled components with Tailwind CSS classes

## Experience

Working with these frameworks was insightful:
- Bootstrap provides ready-to-use components but can feel restrictive
- Tailwind offers more flexibility with utility classes but requires learning many class names
- React's component-based architecture makes building interactive UIs straightforward

The main challenge was adjusting to each framework's approach to styling and layout, but the documentation for each was helpful.
